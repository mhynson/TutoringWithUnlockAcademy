# Unlock Academy Tutoring Session October 28, 2020

Wednesday's session is a continuation of Monday's (see https://github.com/mhynson/TutoringWithUnlockAcademy/tree/master/2020-10-26), where we continue to flesh out this PSD and convert it to a set of HTML and CSS documents. We also take a break to discuss two different ways to center an image within a container.
